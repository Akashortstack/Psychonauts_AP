Fix AP items list to remove numbers from items 
    Increasing counts from base values by one for each item type placed in gen seed table, 
    need to change items table to specify quantities of each item
    How do we keep track of which items have and haven't been sent to player if item ids all match when sent?

    Confusion
    Ignite
    TK Grab?

List of logic fixes:
    --MM Post Office Lobby now in correct region
    --MM2 Sniper requires Shield, not Invisibility
    --Snail/Knight only requires TK and not Fred's Letter
    --Diego's House Grindrail and Diego's Room had their names around the wrong way, swapped
    --Change BV logic to not require Cobweb for going past Heart Street
    --Finishing Waterloo World requires Levitation
    --Meat Circus awning has it's own region for only Levitation
    --Floor of Oly Escort now part of opening mind chests
