Adjust the settings in the YAML to your liking

7. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe

8. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads

9. Unzip the AP_XXX.zip file. Find the zipped file containing your player number and name, and unzip it. This contains a file called RandoSeed.lua 

10. Find your Psychonauts game directory and open /ModResource/PsychoRando/Scripts

11. Paste RandoSeed.lua from your generated Archipelago file into this folder. Replace the file in the destination if needed.

12. Run AstralatheLauncher.exe to open the game. You should see your player number and name on the menu screen.

13. From the menu, enter the yellow door to start a new game.

**DO NOT CONNECT AND ENTER YOUR SLOT NAME UNLESS YOU ARE CHOOSING A NEW SAVE FILE OR HAVE STARTED A NEW GAME**
Connecting from the main menu may result in sending locations from previous playthroughs.

15. If you've started a new save file and connected to the server, you can start playing!

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.
